# Frontend Mentor - Conference ticket generator

Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS

I wanted to challenge myself to build this project using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
It was a fun challenge and I learned a lot more about making forms accessible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
