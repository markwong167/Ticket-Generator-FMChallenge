# Frontend Mentor - Conference ticket generator

I wanted to challenge myself to build this project using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
It was a fun challenge and I learned a lot more about making forms accessible.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3

### Continued development

- Integrate it into an actual web application

### Useful tools

- Prettier: never go without a code formatter
- VSCode: my go-to IDE
- ONLY when you get really stuck after exhausting all other options should you use AI code assistants for this challenge, or when it's mundane tasks like writing this README.md file.
